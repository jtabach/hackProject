# hackProject

This project is a game designed to allow the user to simulate being an NHL player from the NHL Draft
through retirement.

Along the journey the user can simulate games, earn and update their skills/attributes,
try and qualify for the playoff, and hopefully win a Stanley Cup or two.

As your player gains experience, attribute points can be earned to help your player perform better in games 
and even directly effect the outcome of the game. All attribute points are weighted to increase specific stats.

Player stats are simulated for every game as well as recorded to compare your stats from one season to the next.

The game simuation reveals the score of the game one period at a time allowing the user to experience some
suspence, rather than seeing an immediate result.

This project focuses on using higher order functions, built in jQuery callbacks as well as callbacks created myself.
It incorporates the use of hiding and showing divs and setting conditionals as to not allow the user to permission to
click on buttons at inappropriate times.

FUTURE ADDS --

Ways the game can be improved - a quick sim option to allow the user to simulate mulitple games at once, 
and move through the seasons/playoffs at a quicker rate.
