Hack Reactor Interview Project

This project is a game designed to allow the user to simulate being an NHL player from the NHL Draft through retirement.

Along the journey the user can simulate games, earn and update their skills/attributes, try and qualify for the playoff, earn achievements, and hopefully win a Stanley Cup or two.

As your player gains experience, attribute points can be earned to help your player perform better in games and even directly effect the outcome of the game. All attribute points are weighted to increase specific stats.

Player stats are simulated for every game as well as recorded to compare your stats from one season to the next.

The game simuation reveals the score of the game one period at a time, allowing the user to experience some suspence, rather than seeing an immediate result. The simulation will have an option to increase/decrease the speed of the simulation to play at the rate of the user's liking.

This project focuses on using higher order functions and built in jQuery callbacks. It incorporates a strong use of objects to hold click handlers, permissions, update the HTML of divs, and keep track of a variety of stats and achievements.

The player has some flexibility in their choice of game duration. They can chose to enjoy a long, more realistic, season and playoffs, or short and sweet, fast paced action.

The player qualifies for the playoffs by winning at least half of their season games. The playoffs consist of 4 series in order to win the Stanley Cup.

Important Note: By selecting a shortened season the player will likely not be able to earn all of the achievements within a realistic amount of seasons, as many achievements require many games to achieve.

Enjoy!
